                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I am Leah Stevens, a Stockton based artist with a love and passion for Digital Illustration, Graphic
                    Design, and Video Art. I am experienced in many Adobe platforms including Photoshop, Illustrator,
                    and Premiere Pro/After Effects. My work covers many topics I am passionate about including environmental issues, mental health, and much more.
                    My inspiration comes from many sources including my hometown, family, and media.</p>

                    <h3>Sweet Lies</h3>
                    <p> Sweet Lies is a digital satirical poster that focuses on the promotion of vape products to
                        young adolescence. It is a spin on the serious and relevant topic surrounding the concern of
                        addiction starting at young
                        ages, as well as how vape ads are targeted to the younger generation through the use of eye
                        catching graphics and bright colors.

                    <h3>Fragility</h3>
                    <p>Fragility is a digital illustration created in Adobe Illustrator. It is an abstract portrait of a
                        young woman depicted in shattered glass with many missing pieces.
                        This is a personal piece that focuses on the topic of mental health and the fragility one may
                        feel when struggling with self identity.
